Hi, 

Welcome to my project!

I'm currently working on an American Football style game. My background is in C# .net developement, 
with a passion and knack for math and phsyics. Currently the very basic game concepts exsist, 
including pass arcs, Wr route running, DB Zone coverage. My current timeline looks to have a basic game
concept ready by the end of March, with most gameplay tuning occuring from June into July. I am always looking 
for more help, specifically creating models and animations. Character movement will be code based, 
not animation based. Join our discord at https://discord.gg/Mp3cZ5j
