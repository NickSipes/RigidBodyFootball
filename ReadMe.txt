Hi, 

Welcome to my project! 


Beginning of Feb Update:
I'm currently working on an American Football style game. My background is in C# .net developement, 
with a passion and knack for math and phsyics. Currently the very basic game concepts exsist, 
including pass arcs, Wr route running, DB Zone coverage. My current timeline looks to have a basic game
concept ready by the end of March, with most gameplay tuning occuring from June into July. I am always looking 
for more help, specifically creating models and animations. Character movement will be code based, 
not animation based. Join our discord at https://discord.gg/Mp3cZ5j


March 1st
I've begun adding //todo in code where semi experienced codes could help. They include things as simple 
as creating stats variables where I hard code floats, and as difficult as extracting functions 
and creating a more modular enviroment. I continue to try to use code as simple as possible get mechanics working, 
while worrying about refactoring and optimizing after mechanics are working. Currently still on goal for deployment.  
The first set of videos are being pushed to youtube.

Mid March: 
Ran into a bit of a gameplay developement block as I worked through bad code and reworked some ugly things that were bothering me.
Specifically to clean up the DB script, which had become a cascade of nested ifs. 

Completed Tasks
