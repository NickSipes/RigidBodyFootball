Hi, 

Welcome to my project!

I'm currently working on an American Football style game. My background is in C# .net developement, 
with a passion and knack for math and phsyics. Currently the very basic game concepts exsist, 
including pass arcs, Wr route running, DB Zone coverage. My current timeline looks to have a basic game
concept ready by the end of March, with most gameplay tuning occuring from June into July. I am always looking 
for more help, specifically creating models and animations. Character movement will be code based, 
not animation based. 

Completed Tasks
02/25/19 - Add run game mechanics, allow selection between hand off and pass, Add reset scene and hike ball mechanic
02/27/19 - Retarget Football animations, get pass animation to play 
Current Timeline (anticipated date of feature deployment):
03/01/19 - Fix rootmotion issue in hiking the football
